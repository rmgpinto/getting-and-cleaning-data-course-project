# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This repository was created for the assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project, from the Getting and Cleaning Data Course by Johns Hopkins University.

It contains the following files:

* a code book that describes the variables, the data, and the transformations done to the data sets: `CodeBook.md`;
* this file that explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.

# Running the R script
To run the `run_analysis.R` script you can either fork the repo or download the script. Then you can open it in [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) and source the script using the `source()` function.
